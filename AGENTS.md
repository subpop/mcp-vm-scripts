# Agent Context: RHEL VM Setup Scripts

This document provides essential context for agents working on this codebase.

## Project Purpose

This is a cross-platform VM automation tool for creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) test VMs. It's designed for MCP (Model Context Protocol) testing but is generally useful for anyone needing automated RHEL VM provisioning.

## Architecture Overview

### Cross-Platform Design

The codebase uses **platform abstraction** to support both Linux and macOS:

1. **Main Entry Point**: `tools/mcpvm`
   - Multi-command CLI with subcommands: `setup`, `list`, `start`, `stop`, `delete`
   - Detects platform via `uname -s` (Linux/Darwin)
   - Sources the appropriate platform implementation
   - Orchestrates VM lifecycle management

2. **Platform Implementations**:
   - `tools/lib/platform-libvirt.sh` - Linux (KVM/libvirt/virsh)
   - `tools/lib/platform-vfkit.sh` - macOS (vfkit/Virtualization.framework)

3. **Shared Libraries**:
   - `tools/lib/common.sh` - Platform-agnostic utilities (validation, SSH, Ansible)
   - `tools/lib/cloudinit.sh` - Cloud-init ISO generation

### Key Abstraction Pattern

All platform-specific functions use the `platform_*` naming convention:
- `platform_check_prerequisites()` - Verify required tools
- `platform_validate_base_image()` - Check base image exists
- `platform_check_vm_exists()` - Prevent duplicate VMs (exits on error)
- `platform_vm_exists()` - Check if VM exists (returns boolean)
- `platform_create_vm()` - Create and start VM
- `platform_get_vm_ip()` - Retrieve VM IP address
- `platform_list_vms()` - List all mcpvm-managed VMs
- `platform_start_vm()` - Start a stopped VM
- `platform_stop_vm()` - Stop a running VM
- `platform_delete_vm()` - Delete VM and clean up resources

This allows the main script to call platform functions without knowing the implementation details.

## Important Technical Decisions

### Cloud-init vs virt-customize

**The project uses cloud-init for VM provisioning** (as of recent refactoring). Previous versions used virt-customize, but this was macOS-incompatible.

Cloud-init approach:
1. Generate an ISO with `meta-data` and `user-data` files
2. Attach ISO as a removable drive during VM creation
3. RHEL cloud images auto-detect and execute cloud-init on first boot
4. ISO performs: user creation, SSH setup, subscription registration, mDNS setup

**Why this matters**: When modifying VM configuration, edit `tools/lib/cloudinit.sh:create_cloudinit_iso()`, not platform-specific files.

### ISO Generation Tools

- **Linux**: Uses `xorriso` (replaced older `genisoimage`)
- **macOS**: Uses `hdiutil` (native tool)

Both create ISO9660 images with Joliet extensions and volume label `cidata` (cloud-init convention).

### Architecture Differences

- **Linux**: x86_64 VMs using libvirt/KVM
- **macOS**: aarch64 (ARM64) VMs using vfkit/Virtualization.framework

Base images must match the platform architecture.

## File Locations & Conventions

### User Configuration
- **Config**: `~/.config/mcpvm/config.env` (Red Hat subscription credentials)
- **SSH Key**: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (ed25519 preferred, rsa fallback)

### VM Storage
- **Base Images**: `~/.local/share/mcpvm/rhel-X.Y-{x86_64-kvm,aarch64}.qcow2`
- **Linux VM Disks**: `~/.local/share/libvirt/images/<name>.qcow2`
- **macOS VM Disks**: `~/.local/share/mcpvm/disks/<name>.qcow2`

### QCOW2 Backing Files
VMs use QCOW2 backing files pointing to base images for storage efficiency. The `qemu-img create -b` command creates a copy-on-write overlay.

## Network Configuration

### mDNS/Avahi Setup
VMs are configured to be accessible at `<name>.local` via:
1. Cloud-init sets hostname and FQDN
2. Avahi package installed and enabled
3. Hostname resolves without DNS

### Platform Networking
- **Linux**: Uses libvirt's `default` network (NAT with DHCP)
- **macOS**: Uses vfkit's shared network (NAT with DHCP)

Both provide DHCP and NAT for outbound connectivity.

## SSH Host Key Management

The `wait_for_ssh_and_add_known_host()` function in `common.sh`:
1. Waits for SSH to be available on VM IP
2. Scans host keys via `ssh-keyscan`
3. Writes keys to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` using the **hostname** (not IP)
   - Example: Keys from `192.168.122.100` written as `test-vm.local ssh-rsa ...`
4. This allows immediate passwordless SSH via `ssh user@test-vm.local`

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Cloud-init Configuration
Edit `tools/lib/cloudinit.sh:create_cloudinit_iso()`:
- Modify `user-data` heredoc
- Use placeholder variables (e.g., `__HOSTNAME__`)
- Replace placeholders with `sed` before ISO creation

### Supporting a New Platform
1. Create `tools/lib/platform-<name>.sh`
2. Implement all `platform_*` functions
3. Add platform detection case in `tools/mcpvm`
4. Update ISO generation in `cloudinit.sh` if needed

### Modifying VM Resources
**Linux**: Edit `platform-libvirt.sh:platform_create_vm()`, modify `virt-install` flags:
- `--memory 4096` - RAM in MB
- `--vcpus 2` - CPU count

**macOS**: Edit `platform-vfkit.sh:platform_create_vm()`, modify vfkit arguments:
- Memory and CPU are passed to the vfkit command line

**Note on Disk Management (macOS)**:
- vfkit uses CoW clones of the raw base image in `~/.local/share/mcpvm/vfkit/disks/`
- Cloud-init ISO and VM state live under `~/.local/share/mcpvm/`

### Debugging VM Creation Issues

**Cross-platform**:
```bash
# List all mcpvm-managed VMs and their state
./tools/mcpvm list
```

**Linux**:
```bash
# Check libvirt logs
journalctl -u libvirtd -f

# View VM console
virsh -c qemu:///system console <name>

# Check VM state
virsh -c qemu:///system dominfo <name>
```

**macOS**:
- Serial output is logged to `~/.local/share/mcpvm/vfkit/<name>-serial.log`
- Check vfkit process and logs in `~/.local/share/mcpvm/vfkit/`
- Check system logs: Console.app

## Error Handling Conventions

- `error()` - Fatal errors, exits with code 1
- `warn()` - Non-fatal warnings, continues execution
- `info()` - Status messages

All use colored output (red/yellow/green) for visibility.

## Commit Message Guidelines

When creating commits, follow these conventions:

**Commit message structure:**
- **Subject line**: Brief summary of the change (imperative mood, e.g., "Fix cloud-init ISO cleanup issue")
- **Body**: The body of a commit message should consist of a short description of what was wrong or needed improvement (1 sentence for a small change - a short paragraph of two-three sentences for a major change) followed by a high-level description of what was changed. Commit messages should not contain information about wrong paths or bugs that were introduced and fixed within the same session before committing.
- The body should be line-wrapped at a width of about 72 characters.

**Best practices:**
- Focus on the "why" and "what" of the final solution
- Omit implementation details that were tried and abandoned during development
- Don't mention bugs or errors that were fixed before the commit
- Keep the tone professional and focused on the outcome

## Testing Considerations

### Prerequisites for Testing
- Requires actual RHEL base images (cannot be mocked easily)
- Needs valid Red Hat subscription credentials
- Platform-specific VM software must be installed

### Destructive Operations
- VM creation modifies the libvirt database (Linux) or creates vfkit state (macOS)
- Creates disk files that consume storage
- Modifies `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

Always test with disposable VM names.

### Platform-Specific Testing
You can only test the platform you're running on:
- Linux CI: Can test libvirt path
- macOS CI: Can test vfkit path
- Cross-platform testing requires both environments

## Recent Changes & Migration

### Cloud-init Migration (Recent)
- **Before**: Used `virt-customize` to modify base images
- **After**: Uses cloud-init ISO attached to unmodified base images
- **Reason**: virt-customize unavailable on macOS

If working with older commits, be aware of this architectural change.

### ISO Tool Changes
- **Before**: Used `genisoimage`
- **After**: Uses `xorriso` (Linux) / `hdiutil` (macOS)
- **Reason**: `xorriso` is more actively maintained, ships with modern distros

## VM Naming Convention

All VMs managed by mcpvm use the `mcpvm-` prefix:
- **Explicit names**: Must start with `mcpvm-` (e.g., `mcpvm-my-test`)
- **Auto-generated names**: Format is `mcpvm-<adjective>-<utensil>` (e.g., `mcpvm-rustic-spatula`)
- The prefix is enforced by `validate_vm_name()` in `common.sh`
- `platform_list_vms()` filters VMs by this prefix

**Why this matters**: The naming convention allows mcpvm to identify which VMs it manages vs. other VMs on the system.

## Ansible Integration

The `mcpvm setup --playbook=<path>` option enables post-provisioning automation:
1. After VM creation and SSH setup, mcpvm waits for hostname resolution via mDNS
2. This indicates cloud-init has completed and Avahi is running
3. The specified Ansible playbook is then run against the VM

Key functions in `common.sh`:
- `wait_for_hostname_resolution()` - Polls until `<name>.local` resolves
- `run_ansible_playbook()` - Executes playbook against the VM

## Known Limitations

1. **VM Name Restrictions**: Must start with `mcpvm-` and cannot contain periods
2. **Network Mode**: Fixed to shared/NAT (no bridged mode support currently)
3. **Resource Configuration**: Hardcoded (4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs on Linux; vfkit resources in platform-vfkit.sh)
4. **Disk Storage (macOS)**: vfkit uses CoW clones; base image can be raw or qcow2 (converted once)

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Based on README notes and code structure:
- Auto-create config.env with interactive prompts if missing
- Auto-create `~/.local/share/mcpvm/` directory
- Make VM resources configurable via flags (memory, CPUs)
- Add VM snapshot/backup functionality
- Support other Linux distros (currently RHEL-specific)
- Console access subcommand (currently requires platform-specific tools)
